# String Tester

This is a problem I did as an application for a job. I had an hour for the following problem:

Implement a method that takes in a list of strings. Its behavior should be the following for each string:

    a) Reverse the string if its length is a multiple of 4.
    b) Truncate the string to 5 characters if its length is a multiple of 5.
    c) Convert the string to all uppercase if it contains at least 3 uppercase characters in the first 5 characters.
    d) If the string ends with a hyphen, remove it, and append the next string in the list to the current one.
    e) Print the string out.

Additionally, give a final report of the total characters in the input, total characters in the output, and median length of all strings.
